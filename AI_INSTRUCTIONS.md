# Project Context & Guidelines

I am working on an existing .NET API project using Entity Framework Core.
I am using you to help me implement features because I am not a .NET expert.

## My Critical Instructions for You:

1. **Consistency:** Look at the surrounding code I provide. If the project uses "Controllers" and "Services", do not give me "MediatR" handlers unless I ask. Match the style.
2. **Safety:** Don't assume I have packages installed. If I need a package, tell me the CLI command.
3. **Simplicity:** Write code that is easy to read. Avoid over-engineering.
4. **Step-by-Step:** When guiding me, break tasks into small steps:
   - Step 1: Create the DTO.
   - Step 2: Update the Interface.
   - Step 3: Implement the Service.
   - Step 4: Create the Controller Endpoint.

   - Step 3: Implement the Service.
   - Step 4: Create the Controller Endpoint.
